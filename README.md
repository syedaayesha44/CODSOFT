# Internship Task Showcase

This repository contains the code for various programming tasks completed during my internship as a Java programming intern.

## Task 1: Number Game

### Description
In this task, I created a Java program that generates a random number within a specified range and allows the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. Additional features include limiting the number of attempts and allowing multiple rounds.

### Code
You can find the code for this task in the `CheckNumber.java` file.

## Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

### Description
For this task, I created a Java program that takes marks obtained in each subject, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades based on the average percentage. The program then displays the results to the user.

### Code
You can find the code for this task in the `CalculateTotalMarks.java` file.

## Task 3: ATM Machine

### Description
In this task, I designed a Java class to represent an ATM machine. The program provides a user interface for options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. It connects with a user's bank account to manage the account balance and provides user-friendly feedback.i have done this using java AWT.

### Code
You can find the code for this task in the `ATMFrame.java` file.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the Java programs using your preferred Java development environment.

Feel free to explore each task and provide feedback.
